## End of Day Report - November 28th, 2024

**Mark Leigh, Trading Expert**  
**November 28th, 2024**

### Highlights

- **European Equities**: Germany leads today’s bounce after 3 days of declines.
- **ECB’s Lagarde**: Tariffs will be harmful to global growth in the long term.
- **Bitcoin**: Gave back some of yesterday’s gains today, on Thanksgiving. A move lower looks in place with a descending trendline on the dailies.
- **NZ Consumer Confidence**: November jumps to 99.8 (prior 91.2).
- **OPEC+**: Discusses delaying output hike due on Sunday, yet still had no effect on the price today.

- Unchanged today. US markets were closed for Thanksgiving. Buyers aim at 106.50 while sellers look to break below 106.

#### S&P 500
- **Bias**: Up  
- Markets closed today.

#### Gold
